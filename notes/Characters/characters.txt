====================
General Guidelines:
====================

- Image should be 800x800 pixels and should have a transparent background.
- The character's shape itself, however, should have a minimal amount of transparent "holes".
- This way, the character's shifting silhouette will look nice.

- See example gif, where the character's background animation is displayed
